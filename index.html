                    <p>An examination of how digital technology is reshaping our understanding of community, intimacy, and authentic human relationships in the 21st century.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>In our hyperconnected age, we find ourselves paradoxically more isolated than ever before. This essay explores the fundamental tension between digital connectivity and authentic human relationships, examining how social media platforms, dating apps, and virtual communities are redefining what it means to truly "connect" with another person.</p>
                        
                        <p>The rise of digital communication has fundamentally altered the landscape of human interaction. Where once we relied on face-to-face encounters, phone calls, and handwritten letters to maintain relationships, we now navigate a complex web of likes, shares, comments, and instant messages.</p>
                        
                        <p>Consider the phenomenon of "digital intimacy" - the way couples share their daily lives through constant texting, photo sharing, and video calls. While this creates an unprecedented level of connection and accessibility, it also raises questions about privacy, authenticity, and the nature of intimate space.</p>
                        
                        <p>The essay further examines how social media platforms commodify human relationships, turning friendship and romantic connection into metrics and algorithms. The "attention economy" transforms our social lives into a competition for likes, views, and engagement, potentially undermining the intrinsic value of genuine human connection.</p>
                        
                        <p>Yet this technological revolution also offers unprecedented opportunities for connection across geographical and cultural boundaries. Online communities provide support networks for marginalized groups, long-distance relationships maintain intimacy through digital tools, and virtual spaces create new possibilities for creative collaboration and shared experience.</p>
                        
                        <p>The conclusion argues for a more mindful approach to digital communication - one that harnesses the connective power of technology while preserving the irreplaceable elements of human presence, vulnerability, and authentic encounter.</p>

                    <p>A critical analysis of how contemporary authors use fragmented narrative structures to explore themes of memory, trauma, and personal identity.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>Postmodern literature has fundamentally challenged traditional notions of linear narrative and coherent identity. This analysis examines how authors like Jennifer Egan, Kazuo Ishiguro, and Toni Morrison employ fragmented storytelling techniques to mirror the fractured nature of human memory and the constructed nature of personal identity.</p>
                        
                        <p>The traditional bildungsroman assumed a stable, developing self moving through time toward greater self-knowledge and maturity. Postmodern authors reject this model, instead presenting characters whose identities shift, fragment, and reconstruct themselves in response to trauma, cultural displacement, and the unreliability of memory itself.</p>
                        
                        <p>Jennifer Egan's "A Visit from the Goon Squad" exemplifies this approach through its non-linear structure, jumping between characters and time periods to create a mosaic of interconnected lives. The novel suggests that identity is not a fixed entity but rather a series of moments and relationships that gain meaning only in retrospect.</p>
                        
                        <p>Kazuo Ishiguro's "Never Let Me Go" uses the unreliable narrator technique to explore how individuals construct meaning from incomplete information about their own lives. The protagonist Kathy's gradual revelation of her true circumstances mirrors the way we all piece together our identities from fragments of memory, social conditioning, and selective forgetting.</p>
                        
                        <p>These authors suggest that identity is not discovered but actively constructed through the stories we tell about ourselves. The fragmented narrative structure becomes a formal expression of this understanding, challenging readers to actively participate in creating meaning from textual fragments.</p>

                    <p>Exploring the moral imperatives and philosophical frameworks needed to address our current environmental crisis through individual and collective action.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>The climate crisis presents perhaps the greatest ethical challenge of our time, forcing us to reconsider fundamental assumptions about human responsibility, intergenerational justice, and our relationship with the natural world. This essay examines competing ethical frameworks for environmental action.</p>
                        
                        <p>Traditional utilitarian approaches to climate change focus on maximizing overall welfare while minimizing harm. This framework supports policies like carbon pricing and cost-benefit analyses of climate interventions. However, pure utilitarianism struggles with questions of distributive justice.</p>
                        
                        <p>Rights-based approaches emphasize the fundamental right to a livable environment and the corresponding duties this creates. This framework is particularly powerful when addressing climate justice issues, as it highlights how climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Virtue ethics asks what kind of people we should be in relation to the natural world. This approach emphasizes character traits like humility, temperance, and respect for nature. It suggests that environmental problems stem not just from wrong policies but from corrupted relationships with the natural world.</p>
                        
                        <p>The essay argues that effective climate action requires all these ethical perspectives. We need utilitarian calculations to understand the scope of required changes, rights-based frameworks to ensure just transitions, virtue ethics to transform our relationship with consumption and nature.</p>

                <p>BA Philosophy Thesis - University of Groningen (2024). An interdisciplinary investigation integrating contemporary neurological insights with philosophical theories to explore the relationship between willpower and free will.</p>
                <div class="project-full-text">
                    <h4>Table of Contents:</h4>
                    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong><br>
                    Introduces the central research question and David Goggins as a case study for extraordinary willpower. Establishes the framework for examining willpower through both neuroscience and philosophy.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>2. State of the Art Science and Philosophy</strong><br>
                    <strong>2.1 The Dopamine Desire Circuits:</strong> Explains the dopamine desire circuit (dDC) and control circuit (dCC), their roles in motivation and self-control.<br>
                    <strong>2.2 The Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex:</strong> Discusses the aMMC's role in tenacity and how sustained effort enlarges grey matter in this region.<br>
                    <strong>2.3 Harry Frankfurt's Theory:</strong> Examines first-order and second-order desires, and second-order volitions as foundations for understanding free will.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3. Desires</strong><br>
                    <strong>3.1 Parallels:</strong> Draws connections between Frankfurt's philosophical framework and scientific understanding of dopamine circuits.<br>
                    <strong>3.2 Refuting Frankfurt's Theory:</strong> Critiques the hierarchy of desires using the concept of "resolve" and evidence from the aMMC.<br>
                    <strong>3.3 Identifying with Desires:</strong> Defends Frankfurt's distinction between internal and external desires using dopamine research.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4. Free Will</strong><br>
                    Argues that willpower is essential for exercising free will, proposing that individuals with greater willpower are more free. Challenges Frankfurt's requirement for alignment between first-order desires and second-order volitions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>5. Limitations and Outlook</strong><br>
                    Discusses the finite nature of willpower as a biological constraint on free will and considers implications for quantifying freedom. Explores whether complete freedom is attainable given our biological limitations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>6. Conclusion</strong><br>
                    Synthesizes findings to show that willpower, understood through the dCC and aMMC, is essential for free will. Concludes that free will involves the ability to act on desires reflecting our true selves, free from impulsive external forces.</p>

                    <h3><a href="posts/archivists-dilemma.html">The Archivist's Dilemma</a></h3>
                    <p>A short story about a librarian who discovers that books in her collection are mysteriously changing their contents, forcing her to question the nature of truth and permanence.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>Margaret had been the head librarian at the Whitmore Public Library for thirty-seven years, and in all that time, she had never encountered a problem that couldn't be solved with proper cataloging and meticulous attention to detail. That changed on a Tuesday morning in October when she discovered that page 247 of "The Great Gatsby" no longer contained the famous green light passage.</p>
                        
                        <p>Instead, the page read: "And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the future." The word "future" where "past" should have been made Margaret's hands shake as she held the familiar green cover.</p>
                        
                        <p>She checked three other copies. All the same. The change was consistent, systematic, as if it had always been this way. But Margaret remembered the original line—she had quoted it in dozens of book club discussions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the following weeks, other changes appeared. In "1984," Room 101 had become Room 102. In "Pride and Prejudice," Elizabeth Bennet's famous walk through muddy fields had been replaced with a carriage ride.</p>
                        
                        <p>The townspeople didn't notice. When Margaret mentioned the changes, they looked at her with concern. "It's always been 'into the future,'" her assistant Jenny said gently.</p>
                        
                        <p>The story culminates when Margaret realizes that she has become the sole guardian not just of books, but of memory itself. In a world where texts can change overnight, her role transforms from preserver of information to protector of truth.</p>

                        <p>The collection explores how our younger selves' hopes and fears shape who we become, and how writing to the future is itself a form of faith in possibility and continuity.</p>

                    <p>A meditation on loneliness and connection through the story of an apartment building where residents communicate only through notes left in common spaces.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>Apartment 3B had been empty for six months when the first note appeared in the laundry room. But there was no management. The building had been self-managed since Mr. Chen, the superintendent, had passed away the previous spring.</p>
                        
                        <p>The note sparked something. Within days, other notes began appearing throughout the building. Not angry ones—tentative communications, small offerings of connection in a place where people had lived alongside each other for years without speaking.</p>
                        
                        <p>The story follows several residents as they navigate their isolation and gradual connection through these anonymous exchanges. Maria in 2A, recently divorced and struggling with silence. David in 4C, a musician dealing with performance anxiety. Mrs. Patterson in 5D, elderly and mostly housebound.</p>
                        
                        <p>The empty apartment becomes a character itself—the absence around which community forms. The climax comes when the building faces eviction, and the note-writing system becomes a way to organize resistance and document their community.</p>
                        
                        <p>The title reflects both the literal weight of silence and isolation, and the metaphorical weight of potential—how empty spaces can become full of possibility when people choose to reach across the void.</p>
