                    <h3><a href="pdfs/philooflanguage2025.pdf">Reasoning and Insinuation</a></h3>
                    <p>An analysis of Mercier and Sperber's account of reason applied to Elizabeth Camp's work on insinuation, exploring how reason functions as a communicational tool rather than a purely abstract process.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Reason is often seen as the hallmark of human thought – an abstract, deliberate process that guides us to truth. But what if this view is mistaken? In The Enigma of Reason, Mercier and Sperber argue that reason evolved not to help us think better alone, but to justify ourselves to others. This essay explores that shift in perspective and applies it to the phenomenon of insinuation, as analysed by Elizabeth Camp.</p>

                        <p><strong>Mercier and Sperber's Account of Reason:</strong> Mercier and Sperber propose that reason should not be considered something we do internally, before making important decisions. Rather, they argue that reason is inextricably linked to communication between individuals and can only truly be understood from this context. The primary function of reason is not solitary thinking but argumentation – it evolved to help us justify our actions, persuade others, and evaluate the arguments of others within social interactions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Insinuation and Communication:</strong> Elizabeth Camp explores insinuation as a phenomenon that relies on the tension between what is said and what is implied, allowing speakers to communicate indirect messages while preserving deniability. Insinuation is inherently tied to interpersonal communication and relies on what is not said to convey intention while maintaining deniability for the speaker.</p>

                        <p><strong>Reason in Insinuation:</strong> When examining the role that reason plays in insinuation according to Mercier and Sperber's account, we find that the effectiveness of insinuation depends on the inability of the hearer to directly support their interpretation of the meaning of the utterance. What protects the speaker is that the hearer's interpretation is typically based on intuition, not a step-by-step process of traditional reasoning.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> This essay demonstrates how reason functions as a communicational tool that we use to support decisions we arrive at on intuition, when confronted by others and compelled to do so. The effectiveness of insinuation depends on the inability of the hearer to directly support their interpretation of the meaning of the utterance, supporting the view that reason operates primarily in social contexts rather than as an abstract cognitive process.</p>

                    <p>A critical analysis of Kristen Intemann's proposal to merge feminist empiricism and standpoint theory, arguing that feminist empiricism can be strengthened from within rather than requiring such a synthesis.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Feminist philosophy of science investigates how gender, power, and social context influence scientific inquiry. Two major approaches, feminist empiricism and standpoint theory, seek to improve science by making it more inclusive and attentive to social influences. In her 2010 paper, Kristen Intemann proposes a merger between these views into what she calls feminist standpoint empiricism.</p>

                        <p><strong>Intemann's Argument:</strong> Intemann argues that contemporary feminist empiricism is characterized by contextualism, normativity, and a commitment to social epistemology. However, she contends that feminist empiricism lacks a clear account of which values or perspectives should count as epistemically beneficial, making it vulnerable to including even harmful values like those of the Flat Earth Society.</p>

                        <p><strong>Problems with the HIV Researcher Example:</strong> Intemann's example of a female biomedical researcher from sub-Saharan Africa working on HIV vaccines is lacking. The researcher's insight arises from her professional training, domain-specific expertise, and culturally situated knowledge, not from marginalization specifically. The example highlights the relevance of local knowledge and interdisciplinary experience, not necessarily a standpoint derived from oppression.</p>

                        <p><strong>Misunderstanding Feminist Empiricism:</strong> Intemann's argument unfairly distorts feminist empiricism by suggesting it lacks internal criteria to distinguish helpful from harmful values. Feminist empiricists like Longino argue that for a value to play a legitimate epistemic role, it must survive critical scrutiny and be empirically valid. These mechanisms ensure that empiricism does not fall into relativism.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Kristen Intemann's proposal for merging feminist empiricism and standpoint theory rests on a problematic example, a misreading of feminist empiricism, and a risky overvaluation of standpoint epistemology. The better path lies in revising and fortifying feminist empiricism from within.</p>

                    <p>An exploration of personal identity theories through Eric T. Olson's work, arguing that thinking and perceiving cannot be material properties and that persons are best understood as immaterial structures of information.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> What are we, fundamentally? Are we biological animals, material bodies, or something more? This essay explores tensions between the material structure of the human organism and the immaterial qualities of thought, consciousness, and perceiving through Eric T. Olson's "What Are We?"</p>

                        <p><strong>Constitutionalism:</strong> Lynne Baker's Constitution View argues that a person is not identical to the human organism that constitutes them. Instead, a person is a distinct material object that comes into existence when a human organism develops the right psychological and social conditions. Constitution is a relation where one thing makes up the physical basis of another but does not reduce it to what the other is.</p>

                        <p><strong>Animalism:</strong> Olson's animalism denies that we are distinct from animals. Animalists believe that the thinker and perceiver is one and the same as their animal body. Human animals are biological organisms made up entirely of matter with no immaterial parts, yet fully capable of thought and perception.</p>

                        <p><strong>Information as Immaterial:</strong> The part of ourselves that thinks and perceives is best understood as a form of information. Information is not itself material, even if it depends on material substrates. Consider the analogy of a computer: information is expressed through material components, but the content is not reducible to any particular set of particles. The same applies to thinking and perceiving.</p>

                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> What we are, fundamentally, is not a body, nor a body constituted as a person, but a structure of information—an informational pattern that interprets other information, and whose identity cannot be reduced to the material systems it depends on.</p>

                    Introduces the central research question and David Goggins as a case study for extraordinary willpower. Establishes the framework for examining willpower through both neuroscience and philosophy.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>2. State of the Art Science and Philosophy</strong><br>
                    <strong>2.1 The Dopamine Desire Circuits:</strong> Explains the dopamine desire circuit (dDC) and control circuit (dCC), their roles in motivation and self-control.<br>
                    <strong>2.2 The Anterior Mid-Cingulate Cortex:</strong> Discusses the aMMC's role in tenacity and how sustained effort enlarges grey matter in this region.<br>
                    <strong>2.3 Harry Frankfurt's Theory:</strong> Examines first-order and second-order desires, and second-order volitions as foundations for understanding free will.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3. Desires</strong><br>
                    <strong>3.1 Parallels:</strong> Draws connections between Frankfurt's philosophical framework and scientific understanding of dopamine circuits.<br>
                    <strong>3.2 Refuting Frankfurt's Theory:</strong> Critiques the hierarchy of desires using the concept of "resolve" and evidence from the aMMC.<br>
                    <strong>3.3 Identifying with Desires:</strong> Defends Frankfurt's distinction between internal and external desires using dopamine research.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>4. Free Will</strong><br>
                    Argues that willpower is essential for exercising free will, proposing that individuals with greater willpower are more free. Challenges Frankfurt's requirement for alignment between first-order desires and second-order volitions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>5. Limitations and Outlook</strong><br>
                    Discusses the finite nature of willpower as a biological constraint on free will and considers implications for quantifying freedom. Explores whether complete freedom is attainable given our biological limitations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>6. Conclusion</strong><br>
                    Synthesizes findings to show that willpower, understood through the dCC and aMMC, is essential for free will. Concludes that free will involves the ability to act on desires reflecting our true selves, free from impulsive external forces.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conclusion and Outlook</strong><br>
                    Successfully demonstrates that entropic driving forces, rather than enthalpic interactions, govern DNA structure. Modified bead types achieved base stacking and helical structure, though less stable than AA simulations. Recommends future focus on backbone strain optimization.</p>

                    <h3><a href="posts/archivists-dilemma.html">The Archivist's Dilemma</a></h3>
                    <p>A short story about a librarian who discovers that books in her collection are mysteriously changing their contents, forcing her to question the nature of truth and permanence.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>Margaret had been the head librarian at the Whitmore Public Library for thirty-seven years, and in all that time, she had never encountered a problem that couldn't be solved with proper cataloging and meticulous attention to detail. That changed on a Tuesday morning in October when she discovered that page 247 of "The Great Gatsby" no longer contained the famous green light passage.</p>
                        
                        <p>Instead, the page read: "And so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the future." The word "future" where "past" should have been made Margaret's hands shake as she held the familiar green cover.</p>
                        
                        <p>She checked three other copies. All the same. The change was consistent, systematic, as if it had always been this way. But Margaret remembered the original line—she had quoted it in dozens of book club discussions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Over the following weeks, other changes appeared. In "1984," Room 101 had become Room 102. In "Pride and Prejudice," Elizabeth Bennet's famous walk through muddy fields had been replaced with a carriage ride.</p>
                        
                        <p>The townspeople didn't notice. When Margaret mentioned the changes, they looked at her with concern. "It's always been 'into the future,'" her assistant Jenny said gently.</p>
                        
                        <p>The story culminates when Margaret realizes that she has become the sole guardian not just of books, but of memory itself. In a world where texts can change overnight, her role transforms from preserver of information to protector of truth.</p>

                        <p>The collection explores how our younger selves' hopes and fears shape who we become, and how writing to the future is itself a form of faith in possibility and continuity.</p>

                    <h3><a href="posts/empty-rooms.html">The Weight of Empty Rooms</a></h3>
                    <p>A meditation on loneliness and connection through the story of an apartment building where residents communicate only through notes left in common spaces.</p>
                    <div class="project-full-text">
                        <p>Apartment 3B had been empty for six months when the first note appeared in the laundry room. But there was no management. The building had been self-managed since Mr. Chen, the superintendent, had passed away the previous spring.</p>
                        
                        <p>The note sparked something. Within days, other notes began appearing throughout the building. Not angry ones—tentative communications, small offerings of connection in a place where people had lived alongside each other for years without speaking.</p>
                        
                        <p>The story follows several residents as they navigate their isolation and gradual connection through these anonymous exchanges. Maria in 2A, recently divorced and struggling with silence. David in 4C, a musician dealing with performance anxiety. Mrs. Patterson in 5D, elderly and mostly housebound.</p>
                        
                        <p>The empty apartment becomes a character itself—the absence around which community forms. The climax comes when the building faces eviction, and the note-writing system becomes a way to organize resistance and document their community.</p>
                        
                        <p>The title reflects both the literal weight of silence and isolation, and the metaphorical weight of potential—how empty spaces can become full of possibility when people choose to reach across the void.</p>
